          My name is Ola Alkhousi,and since moving to the Netherlands in 2019,
          I've been dedicated to embracing new experiences, learning the Dutch
          language, and connecting with the communities around me.<br />
          Alongside my journey as a software development student, I have also
          engaged in several volunteer activities that have deeply enriched my
          personal and professional growth.<br />

        <h2>Community Engagement and Volunteering</h2>

        <h3>Buddy to Buddy in Zutphen:</h3>

        <p>
          One of my first experiences was joining Buddy to Buddy, where I was
          paired with a wonderful Dutch lady. Together, we explored the city,
          practiced Dutch, and enjoyed photography,coffee, and attending local
          events.<br />
          This not only helped me improve my language skills but also introduced
          me to the beauty of Dutch culture through friendship.<br />
        </p>

        <h3>Community Dinners in Maastricht:</h3>

        <p>
          To further my language skills and meet new people, I regularly
          attended community dinners in Maastricht. These gatherings were a
          fantastic way to engage with others in a relaxed environment while
          practicing conversational Dutch.<br />
        </p>

        <h3>Serve the City Volunteer:</h3>

        <p>
          I also volunteered with Serve the City, helping organize activities
          and support people in need. This experience gave me a deeper
          understanding of community service and strengthened my commitment to
          making a positive impact wherever I can.
        </p>

        <h3>Arabic Language Volunteer Instructor:</h3>

        <p>
          During the pandemic, I volunteered to teach Arabic to students at
          Maastricht University who were interested in learning the language.
          This was a rewarding way to share my culture and language with others,
          despite the challenges of the global health crisis.

        <h2>Education</h2>

        <h3>Damascus University, Syria</h3>
        <h3>Medical Studies | 1 year</h3>

        <p>
          I initially pursued medical studies at Damascus University, but due to
          the worsening situation in the city, it became impossible to continue
          living or studying there. This led me to immigrate to the Netherlands
          with my family for safety and a better future.
        </p>

        <h3>Dutch Language Courses</h3>

        <p>
          When I arrived in the Netherlands in 2019, my first goal was to learn
          Dutch. In 2020, I started my first B1-level Dutch course.
          However, due to the pandemic, I was unable to complete the course and
          had to relocate from Maastricht to Hardinxveld-Giessendam. Later, I
          successfully completed a B1 course online through Taalschool Rijswijk.
        </p>

        <h3>Erasmus University | Schakeljaar</h3>

        <p>
          I then attended a schakeljaar (transition year) at Erasmus University,
          where I earned certifications in Wiskunde B (Math), English (IELTS),
          and the Staatsexamen B2 Dutch.
        </p>

        <h3>Hogeschool Rotterdam | Informatica</h3>

        <p>
          I briefly studied Informatica at Hogeschool Rotterdam, where I learned
          Python through a basecamp and worked with micro:bit devices. However,
          due to personal circumstances, I had to discontinue this program.
        </p>

        <h3>Techniek College Rotterdam | Software Development (MBO 4)</h3>

        <p>
          Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Software Development at Techniek
          College Rotterdam (MBO 4 level), where I am focusing on developing my
          skills in programming and technology.

        <h2>Online Courses and Self-Learning</h2>
        <h3>HTML and CSS | Khan Academy</h3>
        <p>
          While living in the AZC in Maastricht,<br />
          I took an online course in HTML and CSS on Khan Academy. This was my
          first introduction to web development, and it laid the foundation for
          my future in technology.
        </p>

        <h3>Full Stack Development | Akoan</h3>

        <p>
          During the pandemic, alongside my Dutch language courses and
          schakeljaar, I completed a full stack development course through an
          organization called Akoan. This course opened my eyes to the
          complexity and excitement of computer science, leading me to switch my
          career focus from medicine to technology.
        </p>

        <h3>Cybersecurity Lecture | Exact</h3>
        <p>
          I attended a lecture on cybersecurity at Exact, where I learned about
          their training methods and how they approach security in their
          systems. It was an enriching experience that deepened my interest in
          the field.
        </p>

        <h3>CS50's Introduction to Computer Science | EdX</h3>
        <p>
          Currently, alongside my studies at Techniek College Rotterdam, I am
          self-studying CS50's Introduction to Computer Science through the EdX
          platform. This course has given me a solid understanding of the
          fundamentals of computer science.
